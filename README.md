## Just Okay Engine (JOE) -- A Chess Engine Side Project

I am developing this chess engine to learn how to code. It currently draws heavily on Sebastian Lague's [Coding Adventure: Chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk) videos. It is written in Java because I have the most experience in it.

I plan on developing several different engines /  iterations to:

* Explore how Chess/Go/etc. engine coding techniques have evolved over the years.
* Gain more confidence in the software development cycle in general, as well as in specific languages like C/C++ and Python.
* Explore modern breakthroughs in neural networks.

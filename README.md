## Just Okay Engine (JOE) -- A Chess Engine Side Project

I am developing this chess engine to learn how to code. It currently draws heavily on Sebastian Lague's [Coding Adventure: Chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk) videos, but is written in Java because that's what I'm least bad at.

I plan on developing several versions to:

* Explore how Chess/Go/etc. engine coding techniques have evolved over the years.
* Develop experience in differnet languages and paradigms like C, Python, Haskell.
* Practice examining and optimizing code for performance / understand code from a lower level.
* Explore modern breakthroughs in neural networks.
* Boost my ego because I'm not good at chess.
